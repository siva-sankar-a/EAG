# Assignment 5 - Enhanced MCP Client with Gemini AI Integration

## Key Improvements from Assignment 4
- Integration with Google's Gemini AI model for advanced problem-solving
- Enhanced iterative approach with step-by-step reasoning
- Improved error handling and uncertainty management
- Sophisticated timeout handling for AI responses
- Structured response validation and processing

## Server Files

### server.py
A calculator server that provides various mathematical operations including:
- Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Advanced math (power, square root, cube root, factorial, log)
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Image processing (create thumbnail)
- Paint application integration (draw rectangle, add text)
- Code review and debugging capabilities

## Enhanced Client Implementation

### talk2mcp-2.py
A significantly enhanced single-server client that features:
- Integration with Gemini 2.0 Flash model for advanced reasoning
- Sophisticated iterative problem-solving approach
- Robust error handling and uncertainty management
- Structured response formats with validation
- Timeout handling for AI responses
- State management across iterations

Key Enhancements:
- Multi-step reasoning process with self-validation
- Four response types: FUNCTION_CALL, FINAL_ANSWER, ERROR, UNCERTAIN
- Detailed parameter validation and type conversion
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Improved paint application integration
- State tracking across problem-solving iterations

Important Code Features:
```python
# Enhanced system prompt with structured reasoning
def create_system_prompt(tools_description):
    return f"""You are a math agent solving problems in step by step iterations.
    Before each step, think carefully about what needs to be done and explain your reasoning to yourself.
    For each operation, identify the type of reasoning you're using (e.g., arithmetic, string manipulation, visualization).
